## Commentary

- Go provides block comments (`/* */`) and line comments (`//`).
- Line comments are the norm.
- Block comments are mostly package comments.
- Each package should have a package comment (in at least one file).
- Doc comments work best as complete sentences.
- Doc comments starts with the name of the item it describes.
