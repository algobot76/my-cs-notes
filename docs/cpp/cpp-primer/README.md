::: tip  Defined Terms

- __argument__: Value passed to a function.
- __assignment__: Obliterates an object's current value and replaces that value by a new one.
- __block__: Sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in curly braces.
- __buffer__: A region of storage used to hold data. IO facilities often store input (or output) in a buffer and read or write the buffer independently from actions in the program. Output buffers can be explicitly flushed to force the buffer to be written. By default, reading `cin` flushes `cout`; `cout` is also flushed when the program ends normally.
- __built-in type__: Type, such as `int`, defined by the language.
- __cerr__: `ostream` object tied to the standard error, which often writes to the same device as the standard output. By default, writes to `cerr` are not buffered. Usually used for error messages or other output that is not part of the normal logic of the program.
- __character string literal__: Another term for string literal.
- __cin__: `istream` object used to read from the standard input.
- __class__: Facility for defining our own data structures together with associated operations. The class is one of the most fundamental features in C++. Library types, such as `istream` and `ostream`, are classes.
- __class type__: A type defined by a class. The name of the type is the class name.
- __clog__: `ostream` object tied to the standard error. By default, writes to `clog` are buffered. Usually used to report information about program execution to a log file.
- __comments__: Program text that is ignored by the compiler. C++ has two kinds of comments: single-line and paired. Single-line comments start with a `//`. Everything from the `//` to the end of the line is a comment. Paired comments begin with a `/*` and include all text up to the next `*/`.
- __condition__: An expression that is evaluated as true or false. A value of zero is false; any other value yields true.
- __cout__: `ostream` object used to write to the standard output. Ordinarily used to write the output of a program.
- __curly brace__: Curly braces delimit blocks. An open curly (`{`) starts a block; a close curly (`}`) ends one.
- __data structure__: A logical grouping of data and operations on that data.
- __edit-compile-debug__: The process of getting a program to execute properly.
- __end-of-file__: System-specific marker that indicates that there is no more input in a file.
- __expression__: The smallest unit of computation. An expression consists of one or more operands and usually one or more operators. Expressions are evaluated to produce a result. For example, assuming `i` and `j` are `int`s, then `i + j` is an expression and yields the sum of the two `int` values.
- __for statement__: Iteration statement that provides iterative execution. Often used to repeat a calculation a fixed number of times.
- __function__: Named unit of computation.
- __function body__: Block that defines the actions performed by a function.
- __function name__: Name by which a function is known and can be called.
- __header__: Mechanism whereby the definitions of a class or other names are made available to multiple programs. A program uses a header through a `#include` directive.
- __if statement__: Conditional execution based on the value of a specified condition. If the condition is true, the `if` body is executed. If not, the `else` body is executed if there is one.
- __initialize__: Give an object a value at the same time that it is created.
- __iostream__: Header that provides the library types for stream-oriented input and output.
- __istream__: Library type providing stream-oriented input.
- __library type__: Type, such as `istream`, defined by the standard library.
- __main__: Function called by the operating system to execute a C++ program. Each program must have one and only one function named `main`.
- __manipulator__: Object, such as `std::endl`, that when read or written "manipulates" the stream itself.
- __member function__: Operation defined by a class. Member functions ordinarily are called to operate on a specific object.
- __method__: Synonym for member function.
- __namespace__: Mechanism for putting names defined by a library into a single place. Namespaces help avoid inadvertent name clashes. The names defined by the C++ library are in the namespace `std`.
- __ostream__: Library type providing stream-oriented output.
- __parameter list__: Part of the definition of a function. Possibly empty list that specifies what arguments can be used to call the function.
- __return type__: Type of the value returned by a function.
- __source file__:Term used to describe a file that contains a C++ program.
- __standard error__: Output stream used for error reporting. Ordinarily, the standard output and the standard error are tied to the window in which the program is executed.
- __standard input__: Input stream usually associated with the window in which the program executes.
- __standard library__: Collection of types and functions that every C++ compiler must support. The library provides the types that support IO. C++ programmers tend to talk about "the library", meaning the entire standard library. They also tend to refer to particular parts of the library by referring to a library type, such as the "`iostream` library", meaning the part of the standard library that defines the IO classes.
- __standard output__: Output stream usually associated with the window in which the program executes.
- __statement__: A part of a program that specifies an action to take place when the program is executed. An expression followed by a semicolon is a statement; other kinds of statements include blocks and `if`, `for`, and `while` statements, all of which contain other statements within themselves.
- __std__: Name of the namespace used by the standard library. `std::cout` indicates that weâ€™re using the name `cout` defined in the std namespace.
- __string literal__: Sequence of zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes ("`a string literal`").
- __uninitialized variable__: Variable that is not given an initial value. Variables of class type for which no initial value is specified are initialized as specified by the class definition. Variables of built-in type defined inside a function are uninitialized unless explicitly initialized. It is an error to try to use the value of an uninitialized variable. _Uninitialized variables are a rich source of bugs_.
- __variable__: A named object.
- __while statement__: Iteration statement that provides iterative execution so long as a specified condition is true. The body is executed zero or more times, depending on the truth value of the condition.
- __() operator__: Call operator. A pair of parentheses "`()`" following a function name. The operator causes a function to be invoked. Arguments to the function may be passed inside the parentheses.
- __++ operator__: Increment operator. Adds `1` to the operand; `++i` is equivalent to `i = i + 1`.
- __+= operator__: Compound assignment operator that adds the right-hand operand to the left and stores the result in the left-hand operand; `a += b` is equivalent to `a = a + b`.
- __. operator__: Dot operator. Left-hand operand must be an object of class type and the right-hand operand must be the name of a member of that object. The operator yields the named member of the given object.
- __:: operator__: Scope operator. Among other uses, the scope operator is used to access names in a namespace. For example, `std::cout` denotes the name `cout`from the namespace `std`.
- __= operator__: Assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the object denoted by the left-hand operand.
- __-- operator__: Decrement operator. Subtracts `1` from the operand; `--i` is equivalent to `i = i - 1`.
- __<< operator__: Output operator. Writes the right-hand operand to the output stream indicated by the left-hand operand: `cout << "hi"` writes `hi` to the standard output. Output operations can be chained together: `cout << "hi" << "bye"` writes  `hibye`.
- __>> operator__: Input operator. Reads from the input stream specified by the left-hand operand into the right-hand operand: `cin >> i` reads the next value on the standard input into `i`. Input operations can be chained together: `cin >> i >> j` reads first into `i` and then into `j`.
- __# include__: Directive that makes code in a header available to a program.
